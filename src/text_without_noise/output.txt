However, the best salespeople aren’t artists - they’re scientists. They use B2B data to form insights and optimise their work. A B2B sales process provides a framework upon which a salesperson can improvise, while providing 4 additional benefits: 1. Having a more rigid process in place makes it easier for new starters to get up to date. 2. Breaking a sales strategy into stages makes it easier to identify aspects which aren’t working, and adjust them. 3. Seeing where customers are in the sales process makes it easier to forecast more accurately. 4.
